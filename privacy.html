Information Collection and Use

EINSURE LLC is the sole owner of the information collected on this site. We will not sell, share, or rent this information to others in ways different from what is disclosed in this statement. EINSURE LLC collects information from our users at several different points on our website.

Requesting a Quote

In order to use this website, a user must first complete the registration form. During registration, a user is required to give their contact information (such as name and email address). This information is used to contact the user about the services on our site for which they have expressed interest. It is optional for the user to provide demographic information (such as income level and gender), and unique identifiers (such as social security number), but encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our site.

By submitting a quote request, I consent to be contacted by agents of EINSURE LLC and/or partnering companies, regarding the marketing of insurance products at the phone number(s) or email(s) I provide, including my wireless number. Contact methods may include phone calls, text messaging, and/or email. I understand that this consent is not a condition of purchase and that I can call EINSURE LLC directly at 844-990-4977.

Cookies

A cookie is a piece of data stored on the user's hard drive containing information about the user. Usage of a cookie is in no way linked to any personally identifiable information while on our site. Once the user closes their browser, the cookie expires and becomes invalid. For instance, by setting a cookie on our site, the user would not have to log in a password more than once, thereby saving time while on our site. If a user rejects the cookie, they may still use our site. The only drawback to this is that the user will be limited in some areas of our site. Cookies can also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our site.

Log Files

We use IP addresses to analyze trends, administer the site, track user's movement, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. IP addresses are not linked to personally identifiable information.

Links

This website contains links to other sites. Please be aware that we [EINSURE LLC] are not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. We encourage our users to be aware when they leave our site and to read the privacy statements of each and every website that collects personally identifiable information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by this Web site.

Security

This website takes every precaution to protect our users' information. When users submit sensitive information via the website, their information is protected both online and off-line. When our registration/order form asks users to enter sensitive information (such as credit card number and/or social security number), that information is encrypted and is protected by strong SSL (secure socket layer) encryption. While on a secure page, such as our payment form, the lock icon on the bottom of Web browsers such as Netscape Navigator and Microsoft Internet Explorer becomes locked, as opposed to un-locked, or open, when you are not on a secure page. While we use SSL encryption to protect sensitive information online, we also do everything in our power to protect the physical aspect of our users' information. All of our users' information is restricted in our offices. Only employees who need the information to perform a specific job (for example, our billing clerk or a customer service representative) are granted access to personally identifiable information. Furthermore, ALL employees are kept up-to-date on our security and privacy practices. Every quarter, as well as any time new policies are added, our employees are notified and/or reminded about the importance we place on privacy, and what they can do to ensure our customers' information is protected. Finally, the servers that we store personal information on are kept in a highly secure environment with limited access granted to administration personnel only. If you have any questions about the security of our website please Contact Us.

Site and Service Updates

We send our users' site and service announcement updates. Members are not able to unsubscribe from service announcements, which contain important information about the service. We communicate with the user to provide requested services and in regards to issues relating to their account via email or phone.

Correction/Updating Personal Information

If a user's personally identifiable information changes (such as your zip code), or if a user no longer desires our service, we will provide a way to correct, update or remove that user's personal data provided to us. This can usually be done on the member information page or by sending an email to Customer Support.

Notification of Changes

If our privacy policy changes, we will post those changes on our website so our users are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under circumstances if any, we disclose it. If at any point we use personally identifiable information in a manner different from that stated at the time it was collected, we will notify users by way of an email. Users will have a choice as to whether or not we use their information in this different manner. We will use information in accordance with the privacy policy under which the information was collected.
